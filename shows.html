			<h2 class="bulk">One Punch Man</h2>
				<p>
				One of the most exciting, hilarious, and eye-appealing
				anime I've ever watched is One Punch Man. It may sound
				like a cheesy show from the title but it gives hint to
				the playful side of the series.

				<h2 class="bulk">Southland</h2>
				<p> This addicting and dramatic tv series will have you paying 
				more attention to your surroundings. It's thrilling 
				shootouts and suspenseful ultimatums resulted in my 
				love for this series. If you need a new show to watch, go find Southland!
