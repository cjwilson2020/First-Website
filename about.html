			I want to be one of three things--possibly all three one day--, 
			and I will list them in order of least significant to me to most significant. The first 
			aspiration and the least significant would be an IT Manager-- want to know so much about 
			computer components, networks, security, computer architecture, software, and information
			technology that I can manage and run a whole IT department of a huge technological company.
			The second one requires the same, if not more, knowledge about computers and technology 
			as an IT Manager would have. My second most significant aspiration would be a genuine 
			computer scientist. I want to be an iconic figure in the world of computer science and 
			figure out a breakthrough in technology, whether it's hardware, software, data storage, 
			processing speed, or anything else that has problems with potential innovative solutions 
			in the world of computer science. The third and most significant would be an entrepreneur and
			an innovator and create my own big product. Ideally my own brand of technology that can 
			compete with huge corporations like Microsoft, Intel, Apple, IBM, etc. So, essentially I
			can be a big contributor in a tech corporation. I can be a middle man for big corporations 
			nd new companies and have either adapt my new methods, and I can build my own corporation 
			and create an empire.
