					<p>I want to be one of three things--possibly all three one day--, and I will list them in order of least significant to me to most significant. The first aspiration and the least significant would be an IT Manager-- want to know so much about computer components, networks, security, computer architecture, software, and information technology that I can manage and run a whole IT department of a huge technological company. The second one requires the same, if not more, knowledge about computers and technology as an IT Manager would have. My second most significant aspiration would be a genuine computer scientist. I want to be an iconic figure in the world of computer science and figure out a breakthrough in technology, whether it's hardware, software, data storage, processing speed, or anything else that has problems with potential innovative solutions in the world of computer science. The third and most significant would be an entrepreneur and an innovator and create my own big product. Ideally my own brand of technology that can compete with huge corporations like Microsoft, Intel, Apple, IBM, etc. So, essentially I can be a big contributor in a tech corporation. I can be a middle man for big corporations nd new companies and have either adapt my new methods, and I can build my own corporation and create an empire.</p>
